**This is meant to be used for new projects, not existing ones.**

## Requirements

-   Laravel 8+
-   PHP 7.4+

## Installation

To install the preset, simply require it via composer, and run the command.

```sh
composer require austencam/cable
php artisan cable:run
```

If you're really crazy, you can use add this alias to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```sh
function newapp() {
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel ${1:-newapp}
    cd ${1:-newapp}
    composer require austencam/cable
    php artisan cable:run
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
}
```

Then you can run `newapp your-app-name` to start a fresh laravel project with the preset.
